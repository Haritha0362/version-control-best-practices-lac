# Version Control Best Practices for LAC Projects

## Abstract
This project demonstrates how version control systems like Git and GitHub can be effectively used to manage collaborative academic projects. The goal is to teach the importance of structured teamwork, documentation, and professional software development workflows.

## Introduction
In modern software development and academic collaboration, managing multiple contributors, tracking changes, and maintaining consistency is essential. Version control systems such as Git and platforms like GitHub provide a centralized space to manage changes, ensure traceability, and promote teamwork.

## Objectives
- To implement version control best practices in academic projects.  
- To simulate a collaborative project using GitHub.  
- To understand branching, committing, and merging workflows.  
- To improve documentation and traceability in project work.

## Implementation
The project repository was structured with three main folders:
- **/docs/** for documentation and reports.  
- **/src/** for source code files.  
- **/team/** for team details.  

GitHub was used to demonstrate:
1. Repository creation and initialization.  
2. Commit and push operations.  
3. Branch creation for feature updates.  
4. Pull request (PR) creation and merging.  

A simple Python program (`main.py`) was implemented to display version control best practices. The repository was maintained under a main branch and a feature branch to simulate real-world collaboration.

## Tools and Technologies
- Git (Version Control System)  
- GitHub (Remote Repository Hosting)  
- Visual Studio Code  
- Python  

## Results
- Proper project structure and workflow established.  
- Clear demonstration of collaboration via pull requests and commits.  
- Repository successfully maintained following industry standards.  

## Conclusion
This project provided a practical understanding of how version control systems streamline collaborative work. By simulating a real-world GitHub workflow, it enhanced understanding of DevOps fundamentals and professional project management.
